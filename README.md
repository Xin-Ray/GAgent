## 1. What is our goal?

In the future, AI will become more human-like. A paper named "Generative Agent" made a bold attempt using the capabilities of GPT and gaming. In a virtual environment, 25 agents can interact with the environment, humans, and society. These agents will have their own narratives and life stories, offering a glimpse into the embryonic form of a future AI society.
However, I believe there's significant room for improvement in the paper. A current limitation is that these agents don't feel realistic. While they might have objectives, these goals are externally assigned rather than being self-derived. How can an agent possess its own goals and mimic human behavior authentically? I believe the answer lies in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

These agents lack intrinsic needs for survival. For instance, if instructed not to 'eat', they won't perish, whereas a human would. Humans possess physical bodies that require sustenance and emotional connections for emotional equilibrium. Essentially, various hormones dictate our diverse needs.
To make AI more human-like, we should design intricate feedback systems allowing agents to sense hormonal changes, thereby setting their own goals to maintain hormonal balance. If their 'hormonal' levels breach safe limits, their 'existence' could be at risk. This way, when assigned a task, they can intelligently execute it, avoiding imprudent or inappropriate actions.


## Improvement direction details: 
1. Additional vital information(like health bar if this agent donâ€™t eat, it will decrease)/n
2. Add return system(after having interaction with the environment return the health bar an number)/n
3. Additional tasks(Honggang: like give the agent a task of losing weight, and he can then go to gym or do exercise or eat less to lose weight. Xin: these task is focusing on the living related hormone and we can apply it to our agent as first priority, but we can also give them two goals to test if it works. If we give human a wrong order and what this agent will do, if we give a right order what is the difference)/n
4. Use Llama to replace GPT 3.5
